## Introduction

In this notebook, we explore the relationship between suicide rates and various factors. We aim to understand the factors that are correlated with the increase in suicide rates globally. By utilizing EDA, visualization techniques, and machine learning models, we can gain valuable insights into this important issue.

## Data

The data used in this analysis is sourced from [[Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016/data)]. It contains information on suicide rates, as well as various socio-economic and demographic factors for different countries and years. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure its suitability for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, an exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.  examination of the distribution of variables, identifyng missing values, and handling outliers.

## Visualization

In this section, the visualization types that were used are bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize the relationships between different variables.
## Machine Learning Models
Machine learning models trained : linear regression, decision trees, random forests, Gradient Boosting and Bagging Regression.

## Results and Insights

In this section, we present the results obtained from our analysis. We discuss the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models. We highlight the factors that have the strongest correlation with suicide rates and provide recommendations for further research or interventions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of suicide rates using EDA, visualization, and machine learning techniques. By understanding the factors contributing to the increase in suicide rates globally.
